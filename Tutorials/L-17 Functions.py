'''def is basically used to break codes into smaller re-usable segmants.
 def means define.
 think of this as a divider of specific programs.
 ALways use meaningful and definitive names for your functions names no matter how long it is .'''


def greet_user():
    print('Hello there!')
    print('Welcome aboard!')

# the program actually starts from the below line
print('Start')
greet_user() # when the program comes here,it jumps the def function and reads it
print('End')

# def should be always above the actual code
